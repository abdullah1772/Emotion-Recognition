# Introduction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for emotion recognition. Leveraging advanced techniques in computer vision and deep learning, the model is designed to analyze facial expressions and predict emotions accurately. The main component of this project is the emotion-recognition.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

# Features
Emotion recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
Visualization of model performance metrics.
